# obd2 Infotainment Display (using Raspberry Pi 4B)
The following project is designed for those who are using Rhys Morgans' "react-carplay" with a Raspberry Pi in their vehicle. Instead of having a white loading screen on their screen when not using Carplay, this serves as a placeholder. 

By default, this will allow users to have a menu page. They'll have options on different modes while not using Carplay (Still in development).
