# obd2 Infotainment Display (using Raspberry Pi 4B)
The following project is designed for those who are using Rhys Morgans' "react-carplay" with a Raspberry Pi in their vehicle. Instead of having a white loading screen on their screen when not using Carplay, this serves as a placeholder. 

By default, this will allow users to have a menu page. They'll have options on different modes while not using Carplay (Still in development).

## Features
**NOTE THE FOLLOWING FEATURES STILL REMAIN IN DEVELOPMENT**
- Carplay
    - Using Rhys Morgans "react-carplay", users will be able to connect their iPhones and use Carplay for media, navigation, etc.
- Info Mode
    - Displays information about the vehicle
- Track Mode
    - Displays Gravitational Force
- Bluetooth Mode ( ~~Under planning~~ No Longer Under Development)
    - ~~Play media from bluetooth connected devices~~

## Bugs and Issues
### Hardware Issues
- Depending on your geological area, weather can affect the performance of the Raspberry Pi. Warm geological areas may cause Raspberry Pi to overheat, which results in a decrease in performance and an increase in lag/delay.
### Software Issues
- TBD
